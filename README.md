I started to learn Angular from scratch. Following the Udemy course, I created a website to manage recipes and add ingredients to shopping list, control aunthentication by Firebase API. As I mention, I study many new thing from Angular: the basic concept of Angular, databinding, directive, services and injection, routing, Observable (Subject), control Form, pipes, making http requets, authentication, dynamic components (ngIf & modalRef), evironments, lazy loading and deploy Angular app.

Key-features: Angular(10) features and Firebase.
